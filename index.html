							<p class="col-sm-9">
								Cloudbus is an extremely early-stage project that aims to make some of Kevin's research in request routing and resource controls for large-scale distributed computing services more accessible to the public. The project aims 
								to implement network proxies that provide dynamic session-aware controls for distributed, clustered, and networked services. This includes objectives such as: dynamic request-rate control, session-aware data multipathing, and speculative dispatch. The project is licensed under the Affero GPL license and is currently seeking contributors.

							<p class="col-sm-9">
								Raptor is a distributed serverless function executor and scheduler developed to demonstrate the performance benefits of combinatorial block designs and preemption on parallelizable serverless workflows. Raptor is developed in C++ and is designed to be deployed as a docker container by the OpenWhisk serverless computing framework. Raptor uses the SCTP protocol for its distributed scheduling communication interconnects and POSIX job control signals for serverless function process controls.

							<p class="col-sm-9">
								This simulator implements the model of distributed computing outlined in "A Model for Data Processing on Warehouse-Scale Computers," published in the proceedings of the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData). It can be used to verify and compare the performance characteristics of a wide-variety of different scheduling algorithms and approaches. It is implemented in Python as an event-based simulator and includes implementations of a variety of scheduling approaches that are commonly used in practice and in the literature.

							<p class="col-sm-9">Kevin married in 2021. This webpage was used back then to manage RSVP's. Mostly so that items like headcount and dietary requirements were easy to keep track of for vendors, but a little to save money on sending out invitations to guests. The page was written in Angular so that RSVP information (stored in a Firebase backend) could be viewed and administered from an authenticated route on the same domain. Unfortunately, the wedding was changed to an elopment at the last minute due to COVID-19.</p>
